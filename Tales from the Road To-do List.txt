Phase 1:
* Work on making levels more open (Levels still not as open as I'd like. Big area I can improve on.)
* Work on Holly date scene (WIP)
* Figure out how I want to handle road trip destinations
* Write up stuff to do on the computer. Chat rooms are the main idea right now.
* More CSS Styling
* Get art comissioned for main characters (Sasha, Jacob, Holly, Valery). (Maybe? Have some people that'll do it for $5, almost have to at that price)
* Implement basic sound (Royalty free stuff)
* Play through and check for bugs and suspect writing
* See if there's anything that JS can help with or improve
* Maybe implement key bindings (Could be a lot of work)
* ???
