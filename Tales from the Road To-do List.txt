Phase 1:
* Work on making levels more open (Levels still not as open as I'd like. Big area I can improve on.)
* Work on Holly date scene (Almost done)
* Figure out how I want to handle road trip destinations (Ugh)
# Write up stuff to do on the computer. Chat rooms are the main idea right now. (Done)
* More CSS Styling
* Get art commissioned for main characters (Sasha, Jacob, Holly, Valery). (Yessir. Sasha done, others will be commissioned later.)
* Implement basic sound (Done. Want to add more during downtime. Maybe add specific music during certain scenes.)
* Play through and check for bugs and suspect writing (Mostly)
# See if there's anything that JS can help with or improve (Yup)
* Maybe implement key bindings (Could be a lot of work.)
* ???
