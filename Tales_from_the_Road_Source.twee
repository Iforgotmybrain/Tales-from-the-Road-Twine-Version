Either way it might be worth checking out, you've gone to it every other year so why stop now?

<<if $festival_completed is true and $sasha_post_fest_talk is not true>>
You knock on Sasha’s door, hoping to get some input on your road trip itinerary. While Sasha isn’t very well-traveled, you figured it couldn’t hurt to ask her what she thinks about the whole thing. Especially since she spent some years out of state before moving here.

<<continuelink "Sasha answers the door and welcomes you in.">>Sasha answers the door and welcomes you in. “So, what brings you to me today? Wanna talk about someone or something?” She says with an inquisitive tone.

You tell Sasha that you were actually here to talk about something a bit different for once. You go on to state that you wanted to get some input from her on your idea of going on a road trip across the country.

<<continuelink "You explain the whole idea to her.">>You explain the whole idea to her. How you plan on bringing a few other people along, as well as where you plan on going. You feel like it would be a good idea to go in a northwesterly direction so you can check out some of the state parks in the northern mountain states. By the time you leave it should be early Summer, so weather shouldn’t be an issue, and the visuals will be a lot more interesting than going straight through the Midwest.

“Sounds like you already have a pretty decent idea of what you’re doing. I’m guessing you want some input on where to stop in Oregon, right?”

You nod your head, Sasha then thinks for a minute before offering some ideas.

“Hmm, it’s been some time since I’ve lived there, but I can remember a few places that might be worth checking out. Crater Lake is worth a stop, as is Silver Falls. And there’s a bunch of other parks you could check out as well, I’ll write them down for you.”

Sasha writes down about 7 places to check out in Oregon. You add them to your list which you’ll sort through later.

<<continuelink '"Hey, one thing before you leave."'>>"Hey, one thing before you leave. You said you were going to take a few other people along; do you have anybody in mind yet?”

You tell Sasha you haven’t really gotten to that part yet. You wanna finalize your travel plans before doing so.

“Alright, I was just wondering. I’ll have to think about it, but I might be interested in tagging along with you if you end up having room. I’ve never really traveled before, but I guess there’s no time like now to give it go.”

<<set $sasha_post_fest_talk to true>>

<<continuelink "You tell Sasha you’ll keep her in mind.">>You tell Sasha you’ll keep her in mind. You say goodbye and [[head back out to the hallway.|Hallway]]

<<elseif $sasha_talked_1 is not true>>

You knock on Sasha's door and she welcomes you in. Her bedroom is fairly typical with nothing out of the ordinary, except of course for Sasha the black German Shepard sitting at the desk.

<<continuelink "Continue">>

The first thing anyone notices when they talk to Sasha are her blue eyes, contrasting greatly with her darker fur. It's an unusal trait for someone like her.
	
<<continuelink "Hey $name, what's going on?">> "Hey $name, what's going on?" She says, wondering what brings you to her room.

You tell her you just wanted to check in, see how things are going.
	
<<continuelink '"Honestly, not much has been going on."'>>"Honestly, not much has been going on. Just going through the daily routine. Haven't been having the greatest time at work, but with Geology it's not like there's a bunch of other options out there. Especially in this town."
		
You sympathize with Sasha, thinking back to the job you had before your current one. Although luckily your career field is a bit more in demand than Sasha's is.
		

<<continuelink '"Oh, by the way,"'>>"Oh, by the way, I think Jacob wanted to ask you something. He mentioned something about football earlier today."		

<<set $sasha_talked_1 to true>>

You thank Sasha for letting you know, you say goodbye and head out to the [[Hallway]].

You head downstairs and see nothing out of the oridnary. The entrance way where you're currently standing connects directly to the living room and the kitchen. There's also the front door right by the stairs, you could also head back up the stairs to the hallway.

You enter the kitchen and see that it's about as lackluster as ever. Outdated appliances from the early 00s hum along, running off of shoddy repairs and determination. The tiles on the floor are even more dated. Given the peach-like color and styling you imagine they were installed sometime in the 80s.

	As you approach Jacob it's hard to miss his most predominant feature, his antlers. A feature shared amongst all Deer like him. He also has a fairly fit build, though you wouldn't be able to tell that with the baggy sweats and jacket he's wearing today.
	
	"Hey bud, what's going on?" He says as you walk up to talk to him.

		"Dunno if you've been keeping up with the Blues' Head Coach search but it seems like they've narrowed down their choices to two people, Karl Kowalski and Robert Indah. Kowalski is the OC for the Norsemen, not a ton of experience but I feel like his scheme would be a perfect fit for the Blues. And then Indah is the DC for the number one defense in the leauge on the 99ers. Although you have to wonder how much of that success can be attributed to his coaching verus the insane amount of talent they have on defense."

It seems Sasha's watching a superhero movie involving some sort of pink titan.

Looking around you see the line to order, it’s a bit after lunch so there isn’t much of a wait. While walking to the line you see someone you think you know, they're sitting at a table towards the back and it seems as though they haven't noticed you yet.

You could leave the line and go over and say hi to your friend, or you could just stay in line, get your food, and leave.

<<choice [[Go say hi to your friend|Cafe Holly]]>>

<<continuelink "Just stay in line">>

You decide to just do your own thing and order some food. The line moves quick and before you know it’s your turn to order.

You decide to order your usual combo; a tuna wrap with a bag of chips and a drink. Not a bad deal for $4!

:: Cafe Holly {"position":"1296,846","size":"100,100"}
/* Provide more details about Holly's apperance? */
You decide to leave the line and go over and say hi to your friend, Holly.

Holly is a vixen. No, not like that; in the literal sense. You’ve known her since high school and while you haven’t really been in contact much since college, you still consider her to be a friend, albeit a distant one.

<<continuelink "Continue">>

You exchange greetings with Holly and start conversing. There’s a lot of catching up to do, you follow each other on social media but of course that isn’t a replacement for a proper conversation.

<<continuelink "Continue">>

"Wow, Hey $name! It's been awhile. Last time we talked was back in college when we went to that amusement park with some other friends. And the last time I actually saw you regularly was back before you went off to college in like 2013!"

<<continuelink "Continue">>

You fill in some details about what you’ve been up too since that amusement park trip. Detailing your current living situation with Sasha and Jacob, as well as talking about some of your antics in college.

You also ask what Holly’s been up to since you last met, a faint look of disappointment fills her face as she goes on to detail her life post-college.

<<continuelink "Continue">>

"Yeah, so, I dropped out of college at the end of 2016. Believe it or not it wasn’t because of my grades, I just wasn’t enjoying "the college life". I know that’s a pretty shit reason to drop out, but I just couldn’t see myself doing another 2 years there, ya know?. I also hated my major, I realized pretty quick that marketing was not for me."

<<continuelink "Continue">>

You can find yourself agreeing with Holly, remembering how many times you second guessed your choice to attend college.

<<continuelink "Continuie">>

"I knew after I started my first marketing internship that I would have hated that kind job and the corporate culture that surrounds it. Having to stick up to execs, deliver presentations on ideas that would ultimately be ignored by the project managers and higher-ups. Dealing with the petty workplace drama... and not to mention the monotony of it all... That just wasn’t for me You know I've never been one to suck up and deal with other people’s bullshit."

<<continuelink "Continue">>

You can definitely see yourself understanding Holly’s decision, thinking back to all the workplace drama and rejected proposals you’ve dealt with...

You then ask Holly what she’s doing for work since she dropped out of college, she offers a surprising answer.

<<continuelink "Continue">>

"I draw art for a living now! I was always interested in it, I’m sure you remember some of my drawings from back in high school. I never really thought of it as a legitimate career path, but I’ve managed to build a decent enough profile that I can get by on commissions. And you know, I really enjoy it. The customer tells me what they want, I draw it, and we go on our way. There’s (typically) no bullshit, and no one else telling me what to do."

"So, what have you been doing since graduating college? I know you finished with a couple of internships and a great GPA, those internships lead anywhere?"

<<continuelink "Continue">>

You explain that you used to work for Spherion, but eventually quit for various reasons, including reasons she stated, like project managers ignoring ideas. You state that you had luckily saved up enough money to live comfortably for around 2 years before quitting that job. Detailing how you now do freelance work off and on, not unlike what Holly does. It helps keep a steady flow of money coming into your bank account. And with living expenses being split between three people, you really don’t need much money to support your lifestyle.

<<continuelink "Continue">>

"Wow, that’s fantastic. Hearing stuff like that almost makes me wish I would have stayed in college. I couldn’t imagine having a savings large enough to live on for 2 years. Let alone being able to amass that much money by only working for a year and a half! Still, like I said, I enjoy my work and I'm pretty happy with where I am in life. Though having that kind of money never hurts."

<<continuelink "Continue">>

"Well $name, it’s been fantastic talking but I’ve got a yoga class coming up in a half hour so I gotta go. Maybe I’ll see you around some other time."

:: Sycamore Park {"position":"902,1084","size":"100,100"}
You arrive at Sycamore Lakeview Park after a short walk down the street. You’ve never been to this park despite it being close to home. You were always preoccupied by something else, or just didn't feel like going.

The park itself is pretty nice, it features various walking paths and is situated right on the lake, giving it some fantastic views. Most of the paths go through heavily wooded areas, providing amble shade and making it so you can stay relatively comfortable while walking.

<<continuelink "Continue">>

You’re here and ready to make the most it. As you enter the park you see two separate walking paths you'd like to take. One to the west, the other to the east. Which one will you take first?

<<if $path_lake is not true>> [[West Path]] <<endif>> <<if $path_roommate is not true>> [[East Path]] <<endif>> <<if $path_lake is true>> <<set $park_completed to true>> [[Head back home for the day|Your Bedroom]] <<endif>>


:: West Path {"position":"839,1233","size":"100,100"}
You head down the west path and start your walk. 

After walking for 15 minutes you come across a familiar sight, the Great Sycamore Lake. Hence the park’s name. You can see the Sun starting to set over the lake, with the sky starting to turn an orange color with the Sun being reflected off the water.

Not wanting to miss such a beautiful scene, You decide to sit down at a bench overlooking the lake and take a moment to just take everything in.

<<continuelink "Continue">>

While sitting down you decide to reflect a bit on your life. Recently you’ve been having some trouble finding purpose in your life. Your current career brings in money, sure, but you just don't find it very fulfilling. It was fun at first but 1 year into living this kind of life and you’re finding yourself uncertain and a bit depressed. You feel like you lack purpose and direction, your freelance style of work lacks a direct career path. You just hop from job to job.

There are a few things you’ve thought of to try and remedy this issue. Including doing volunteer work, getting a part time job doing something you actually enjoy, or even taking on the dating scene again. One recent thing that’s come to mind is a cross-country road trip. While the road trip itself wouldn’t permanently fix your lack of passion, you could end up discoveing something that reinvigorates you.

It’s an interesting idea, but that’s all it is for right now. An idea.

<<continuelink "Continue">>

<<set $path_lake to true>>

You decide to get up and continue your walk, you feel pretty good after reflecting on your recent issues. You soon find yourself back near the [[park entrance.|Sycamore Park]]


:: East Path {"position":"984,1233","size":"100,100"}
\* Are either of these paths needed for the overall story? Or are they just filler? */

you head down the path to the east. This path is slightly shorter than the other one, as it doesn't go past the lake. 

As you walk across the park you see someone with a Redding University shirt on. The same university you attended! It reminds you of your days in college, and how you met your roommates. 

<<continuelink "Continue">>

You met Jacob in one of your upper-division elective courses, the one about environmental ethics or something like that. Very fitting considering Jacob has been a very outdoorsy type of guy ever since you’ve known him. You ended up starting a study group with him since you weren’t exactly having a great time in that class. Mainly because it was taught by a not so great professor.

It started off as a pretty standard study group, consisting of you, Jacob, and a couple other students. About half way into the semester you started to get to know Jacob a bit better, and you started to hang out with him a bit more outside of the study group.

After that the rest is history, you’ve been good friends with him ever since. To the point that you decided to roommate up with him starting your 3rd year at college.

<<continuelink "Continue">>

You ended up meeting Sasha in a similar way. You ran into her at one of the one of the recitation sessions for your Sociology classes. You started off with the usual college small talk, ‘Hey, what’s your major?’ ‘What dorm do you live in?’ She ended up living in one of the nearby dorm complexes, which shared a dining hall with your building. This led to you and her getting lunch together on a fairly regular basis.

<<continuelink "Continue">>

You talked quite a bit during lunch, and you eventually ended up hanging out with her outside of lunch quite a bit. You didn’t have as much in common with her as Jacob, but you still appreciated her company. You always kept in touch with her throughout the year, often attending various on-campus events together, and helping each other out with classes.

She’s been a really great friend to you, though she can be a bit forgetful and snarky at times. You’re really glad you met her and Jacob during your time at college, who knows how different your current life would be if you didn’t!

/* I really like this scene. Think it was pretty well written  */

You tell Sasha you want to ask her for some advice, that you wanted to ask her for help on finding 'purpose'.

<<continuelink '"Purpose, huh?"'>>"Purpose, huh? Yeah that doesn’t surprise me. Figured it wouldn't be long before you got sick of your current work style."

“Well I’m assuming your issue is that you don't really have anything to chase after. The way your work goes now, you basically jump job to job every month. Hell, I know some months you don't even work. You've got the money to just sit on your ass for a year if you wanted."

<<continuelink "Continue">>

“I have a little bit of experience with this myself, which of course makes me an expert on the topic. Back when I graduated high school, I was a mess. I had zero idea what I wanted to do. My parents wanted me to go to college, but I didn’t feel like I would be cut out for it. And I didn’t want to go straight to working either, since in my hometown there was really no viable career path for me. Factory jobs were long gone, and if you needed an entry level job the only options you had were retail jobs. And those weren't going to take me anywhere.

So, I took a gap year to try and plan my future out. Told myself I’d work part time while ‘researching’ career paths. Now, you know me, how well do you think that worked out? I just worked my part time job and didn’t do jack shit else. Worked my 20 hours a week and then pissed off and went partying with my friends or sat at home all day. It was fun for a few months, but your mind wants something to work towards, and this lifestyle was a dead end.

I started to feel lost after those few months, I had no long-term goals, no real ambition, I'd say I wasn't too far off from becoming a dead beat. Didn't help that I surrounded myself with people just as lost as I was.”

<<continuelink "Continue">>

“After talking with my parents and a couple of my friends who actually did something after high school, I decided that I’d give college a try. I wasn’t going straight to university though; I’d go to community college and then transfer if I ended up enjoying it. This way I'd be out less money if I ended up hating it. This wasn’t my ideal path, but my way of doing things kind of turned out to be a disaster, so I said, “fuck it” and decided to give the more traditional post high school path a go. Ended up liking college quite a bit as you might have guessed given our background. I went in as undecided but found my passion pretty quick, which was Geology.”

"Point is, sometimes you have to go outside your comfort zone to find what you want. Just go out there, say 'fuck it' and try some weird shit, you never know what might happen. You could end up finding your 'purpose', or meeting a lifelong friend. If I were you, I’d start trying out new stuff. Maybe pick up a new hobby, meet someone new, volunteer, I don't know, just do //something.//"

<<continuelink "'Thanks Sasha.'">>Thanks Sasha.

While on the bus you sit next to a man with an ‘I heart NY shirt’ on. He’s carrying a sizable backpack, and based off his apperance he seems to be a tourist.

The man looks to you and asks if you’re going to Lake Fest. You say yes, and that you’ve gone to it almost every year you’ve lived here.

"So you’re a local! I’m Chris.” The Tiger says as <<continuelink "he reaches out to shake your hand.">>he reaches out to shake your hand.


You shake the Tiger’s hand and introduce yourself as $name.

"Yeah, I kind of figured that. This is my second time going to this event and I can't say I've seen much else to do around here.” The Tiger says with a friendly tone. "Anyway, I bet you’re probably wondering why someone would come here just for this one event.”

You can’t say you were really racking your brain trying to figure that out, <<continuelink "but you’ll humor him.">>but you’ll humor him.

“Well, I’m actually on a trip across the country! I do it every year, in some shape or form. Last year I went by train but now I’m doing it by car.” He says with an enthusiastic tone. Clearly he’s quite interested in traveling the country.”

You ask Chris for some more details, you’ve always been fascinated by the idea of traveling the country, but you’ve just never had the time or money to do so. <<continuelink "Ask Chris">>

“Well, I start off my trip on the east coast, in New York city as you might’ve guessed by my shirt.” He says while pointing to his 'I heart NY' shirt. 

"I spend a varying amount of time in each place I stop at. Just depends on what that city has to offer, ya know? The end destination changes every year too. Last year I stopped at San Francisco, and this time around I’ll be heading to Seattle."

You tell Chris that you’ve been interested in doing something similar, you find the idea of traveling the country and seeing all it has to offer to be exciting! 
<<continuelink "Continue">>

"If I could offer one tip, it's to plan ahead of time and check out what’s going to be going in the towns you’re passing by. Try to find the best possible time to leave so you can maximize the events you can go too."

You thank Chris for the advice. If you ever do decide to take on such an endeavor, you’ll definitely make sure to have a plan.

"Well looks like our stop’s up here. It’s been great talking to you.” He says while extending his hand out for a <<continuelink "farewell handshake.">>farewell handshake

<<continuelink '"What I’ve been up to?"'>>"What I’ve been up to?" 

"Honestly, not a whole lot given the time frame. Probably the biggest change in my life has been career,since I actually ended up dropping out of college my Sophomore year. Some stuff happened after that, but right now I’m doing art for a living. Pretty big jump going from a marketing major to an artist.”

[[You tell Holly that is a pretty big jump, you also ask her what exactly lead up to her becoming an artist.|Holly Concert Dialogue]]

“Oh boy, where do I start? Hmm… Guess I’ll go over what I did after I dropped out of college. So, I’ve been drawing since… eh, around middle school I’d say. Back then it was just a hobby, of course. Just something to channel my creative ideas, and maybe show off a bit, ~~heh.~~ "

"Now, when I went to college I ended up making a social media account dedicated to posting my art, I plugged it a bit, ya know, posted my art on a few forums to try and get a following. Ended up working pretty well since I had 5000 followers by the time I dropped out. At this point though, it was still just a hobby, but I was definitely thinking about the money potential. After I dropped out I got a full-time retail job and just kept working on my art and expanding my following as best I could.”

<<continuelink "About what you expected to hear. You ask Holly when she started to see art as an actual career path instead of just a hobby.">> About what you expected to hear. You ask Holly when she started to see art as an actual career path instead of just a hobby.


"Ehh, I started taking commissions shortly after leaving college. I felt like at that point I was good enough to justify people spending money on me, basically. It wasn’t a ton of money, just like beer money really. But it was something! And it was first time I’d been paid for doing art, which definitely helped motivate me."

"About half a year into my retail job I expanded the amount of commissions I took and also opened up a donation page. At this point, the income from my art was actually starting to rack up. Wasn’t as much as my ‘real job’ but it was enough to pay some of my bills every month. I was really starting to see art as a legitimate career path at this point, it took a lot of time and effort to get to this point though. I’d been working on my art since Middle School and I was just now getting enough of a following to sustain myself.”

"From there I just sort of kept expanding my work, I started making merch, I raised the prices of my commissions a bit and set up an account on one of those monthly subscription type of sites. The income from my art eventually took over my retail job’s income. I still ended up working at the retail job for another 2 months just so I could save up some money before I fully committed to art. And now, here I am. I started doing art full-time 9 months ago, and it’s been surprisingly smooth sailing since."

<<continuelink "You congratulate Holly on being able to support herself on her art. It takes a lot of effort and determination to achieve something like that.">> You congratulate Holly on being able to support herself on her art. It takes a lot of effort and determination to achieve something like that.

"For sure. I definitely got lucky being able to get such a huge following in a fairly short amount of time.”

<<if $cafe_holly_talked is true>>

"How about you though? What happened with you and your job? Had to be getting some decent money based off the amount you saved up"

<<else>>

"Now, what have //you// been doing these last 5 years?"
<<endif>>
You explain that you used to work for Spherion, but eventually quit for various reasons. You state that you had luckily saved up enough money to live comfortably for around 2 years before quitting that job. Detailing that you now do freelance work off and on to provide some extra income.

<<continuelink '"Interesting, what made you leave Spherion?"'>>”Interesting, what made you leave Spherion?”

You explain to Holly how it all started. Initially, it all went pretty well. The job paid exceptionally well, had good benefits, and looked really good on a resume if you ever decided to go somewhere else. About 5 months into the job though you started to notice some of the dysfunction abound. You grew tired of the petty office politics, your ‘superiors’ never really valued your work or your feedback, and the work you were doing just wasn’t very fulfilling.

Most workplaces will have elements of all those things, this is true, but here they were overwhelming. You knew you weren’t long for that place and started saving up a decent chunk of your paycheck each month. You put a significant amount into an investment account, as well as some straight into your savings. You stayed for about 7 months after that, and by the time you put in your 2-weeks, you had saved around $40,000 total. Enough to live modestly by yourself for 1 year. Or in your case, more than enough to live with your roommates for 2+ years.

<<continuelink '"Wow, that’s just crazy to me…"'>>”Wow, that just crazy to me. Saving 40k in only one year is just insane. That’s almost how much I make in a year. I’m assuming you started your freelance contract work shortly after that, right?”


<<continuelink "Yes, you started working contracts shortly after being fired.">> Yes, you started working contracts shortly after being fired. They provided a nice in-flow of cash to help keep you going.

“I can totally understand quitting a job because you don’t like the culture, that’s pretty much why I took up art as my career.”

<<timed 7s>>
You bring out your smartphone and look at the time, seems your conversation with Holly was a bit longer than you thought. You talked for almost an hour, and at this point the band is on their last song. The evening is approaching, with only a few more hours left for the festival.

You could ask Holly to accompany you for the rest of the day here at the festival, or you could go your separate ways.

You think about it for a while, eventually deciding too:

:: Festival Games {"position":"118,2222","size":"100,100"}
You and Holly head towards the many fair games set up at the festival.

As you arrive at the games Holly offers a quick remark about them

"I used to always bug the hell out of my parents about playing these games. They’d always say ‘no, you’re not playing those games, they’re a rip-off. I could go to the store and buy you whatever toy it is you want for less money than it would take to win one of those games.' Well guess what Dad, it wasn’t about the toy, it was about the experience. I don’t think the supermarket has you throwing a ball into a bowl in order to get a toy, do they Dad?"

<<continuelink '"They are terribly unfair though,"'>>"They are terribly unfair though, of course I didn’t really understand that as a kid. I think I’ve won a grand total of once. And that was on the basketball one, pure luck was the reason for that win.”

As a kid, you had a similar experience to Holly. Though your parents would occasionally give in and let you play a few.

As you continue walking you see all the games. There’s the basketball game, which is rigged by setting the hoop higher than an official one. The ‘throw this ping pong ball into the water’ game. Which is difficult because the little ball is so light it just bounces off everything. And the BB gun game, which has you shooting a fragile paper target with inaccurate an inaccurate BB gun. This whole place is full of shady business practices.

<<continuelink "Well, you and Holly came here for a reason,">>Well, you and Holly came here for a reason, might as well play at least one of these games.

"I wouldn’t mind playing the one where you try to throw a baseball at a certain speed. It’s up to you though."

You could try the baseball one, you also thought about doing the BB gun one. They're all rigged in some way though, so your odds are probably the same no matter which one you have a go at.

After discussing it, you and Holly decide to have a go at the:

This way doesn’t seem to have much going on, as the only thing of
interest is the small stadium where various events have been held throughout the day. None of which interests you. Indeed, the only thing this path seems to offer is a nice walk. It loops around the stadium and will take you back to where you started. Oh well, if nothing else you can reflect on the day while walking back.

<<continuelink "The day has gone pretty well, you think.">> The day      has gone pretty well, you think. About the same as every other year     you’ve gone.

"Didn’t see much when I went this way before, but who knows maybe something changed." Holly says with a somewhat dismissive tone.

“Seems like this would be a good time to talk about each other. With how long it's been since we've been able to hang out and talk it's almost like starting over. How about we talk about our hobbies, what do you do for fun?"

<<continuelink "You tell Holly about your hobbies...">> You tell Holly about your hobbies, which you find to be pretty uninteresting. Because, well, the truth is, your hobbies are a //bit// basic and boring. You enjoy movies, music, watching TV, and maybe playing video games or watching sports here and there. Among other things.

Holly seems to be a bit surprised as you detail your hobbies, as you call them 'uninteresting' and 'basic'.

"Hmm, I mean, I guess those things could be considered 'basic'. I won’t lie about that. That’s not necessarily a bad thing though. In some cases, I’d say it can even be a positive. The only reason those hobbies are considered 'basic' is because of how popular they. And because of that popularity, it can make it easier to find other people that are interested in the same thing as you are. So long as you don’t let those hobbies become the only thing defining you, it’s fine. I guess you could say that's when you become a basic bitch or bastard. You definitely don’t have that problem, though."

"Ya know, I like a lot of the same stuff. Music, movies, all that. You already know about my art, and I also enjoy fishing on occasion. Guess you should say I’m pretty ‘basic’ as well."

<<continuelink "You also tell Holly…">> You also tell Holly that you like traveling, though you rarely do so due to various reasons. You also mention that you’ve been recently thinking about going on a road trip across the country. She seems pretty surprised by this.

"A road trip across the country, huh? Can’t say something like that has ever crossed my mind before, seems like it would be fun though. Has to be a pretty big commitment, right? You’re basically putting the rest of your life on pause for the duration of the trip.”

"You’d almost have to be doing contract work like us or have some damn good vacation time. Or have a job with a lot of downtime." Holly says, perhaps suggesting something.

<<continuelink "You mention to Holly that..">> You mention to Holly that’s part of the reason you’d never really considered it until recently. There was no way to get that much time off when working at Syperion.

<<continuelink '"It’s definitely a cool idea. What made you think of doing that anyway?"'>>"It’s definitely a cool idea. What made you think of doing that anyway?"

As you walk to the entrance you reflect some more on how the day went.

It’s been a long and interesting day. You came expecting to stay for an hour or two and then go home. But after talking to Holly you decided to stay a bit longer. You had some nice discussions with her but it didn’t really go much beyond that. There just wasn’t enough interest to take it any further than a nice chat. Still, you can’t help but feel like maybe you missed out on something. It’s not every day you get to rekindle a faded friendship.

You continue walking with Holly to her car, eventually reaching it just as the fireworks start to go off.

You both lean on Holly’s car in the parking lot, watching the fireworks as the last bit of sun falls below the horizon, giving way to the stars and planets.

You decide to go with Holly’s first choice and try out the Baseball game. Which has you attempting to throw a baseball at a certain speed in order to win a prize. 

You walk up to the booth and pay for 2 shots at throwing the ball. One for each of you. It cost a total of $7. Which is ridiculous, but like Holly said you’re paying for the ‘experience’. 

You offer Holly the first pitch since this was her first choice.

<<continuelink '"Sure, I’ll have a go at it."'>> "Sure, I’ll have a go at it. I actually played softball when I was in middle school so maybe that’ll give me an edge.”

<<continuelink "Holly lines up at the target.">>Holly lines up at the target. Her goal is to throw the ball at a speed of 60 MPH. A pretty high target for the average person. It’s made even more difficult with how inaccurate the sensor on the target is. It probably hasn’t been replaced or maintained since the thing was first made. Even if it was, there’s nothing stopping the vendor from making it read a bit slower.

She thinks about it for a minute, lining up her throw. She reels back with the ball in her hand, ready to destroy the hell out of that target. She extends her arm and throws the ball at what seems to be a decent speed. The display takes a minute to show the speed, you both wait with mild anticipation, thinking about all the bragging opportunities if one of you were to make it while the other didn’t.

Unbelievable! She actually made it! Quite a feat given all the factors fighting against her. Hopefully you nail it as well, else you’ll never hear the end of it.

The clerk tells Holly she can take any of the various stuffed animals they have hanging up, among them are a stuffed German Shepard, a stuffed Tiger, and a stuffed $race.

Holly chooses the stuffed $race.

Holly throws the ball with all her might, but it wasn’t enough, as the speed is short of the 60 mph target.

Eventually, you feel like you’ve got the perfect form, you bring your arm back, ready to get back some of the money you wasted on this thing.

You throw the ball, you can tell your grip wasn’t quite right, as the ball didn’t seem to have as much oomph as you anticipated. Still, the ball moves at a decent speed, hitting the soft target and letting out an unsatisfying ‘plump’ sound.

:: Festival BB Gun Game {"position":"163,2483","size":"100,100"}
You and Holly decide to check out the BB gun game. This game has you shooting out all of a paper target using an automatic BB gun in the shape of a Tommy Gun. Due to the gun’s incredible inaccuracy and high rate of fire you often end up wasting pellets hitting the same area repeatedly. Which is what makes this game so hard to win.

<<continuelink "You pay the vendor enough for 2 turns on the gun,">>You pay the vendor enough for 2 turns on the gun, one for each of you. The total is $12, a ridiculous price.

"It might be ridiculous, but remember, you’re paying for the ‘experience’” Holly says in her snarky tone.

You decide to play first since it was your idea to check this game out. You line up at the gun. It’s quite beaten up, with most of the paint having chipped away. The gun does have sights on it but they are quite trash, so you’re really just eyeballing it. Not great since the $12 you paid will give you just 300 BB rounds each. Not much considering how fast the gun fires.

<<continuelink "Thinking about strategies you could use to beat this game,">>Thinking about strategies you could use to beat this game, you feel the best way to win would be to shoot the outside of the target first.

<<continuelink "You take hold of the gun and aim down its rudimentary sights,">>You take hold of the gun and aim down its rudimentary sights, it’s bolted down to a rail which prevents you from aiming the gun with anything resembling decent accuracy. Guess you’ll just have to make do. You start to shoot the target, with each pull of the trigger about 10 BB pellets fly out. An unnecessary amount, no doubt it was made that way in order to reduce your chance of winning.

<<continuelink "You start off doing a pretty decent job,">>You start off doing a pretty decent job, you’ve shot out a decent chunk of the target, with about half of it remaining. It’s getting quite difficult at this point though since there’s less and less of the target to shoot. Instead of being able to essentially aim in the general area of the target to hit something, you've gotta be more careful with your shots. Which is difficult given the gun’s poor movement and sights.

<<continuelink "You knock out some more of the target,">>You knock out some more of the target there’s about 25% remaining, but you only have 100 pellets to get the rest of it done. At this point, your shots are missing more than they are hitting. The remaining pieces of the target aren't supported by much, which leads to the paper just giving way to pellets, dealing no damage. 

You’re just about to knock out the target, you aim the gun perfectly, your finger on the trigger ready to finally win one of these silly games.

<<set $pc_win_int to random(30, 100)>>

<<if $pc_win_int gte 70>>
You push the trigger and the last barrage of BB pellets is unleashed. They hit the last bit of the target perfectly, destroying the last evidence of its existence.

Despite all the odds against you, you made it! You won!

The vendor begrudgingly tells that you have the pick of any cheaply made stuffed animal in stock. You decide to pick the Dragon, as it seemed to be highest quality one of the bunch.

<<else>>
You push the trigger, ready to decimate the last of that pain in the ass target, but as you do you hear a clicking noise, and nothing comes out. You’ve run out BB pellets.

Goddmanit! You were this close to winning! You know you would have won if the gun wasn’t such a piece of trash. Oh well, it’s over. Maybe Holly will have some better luck. Which is really all these games are based on.
<<endif>>

<<continuelink "It’s Holly’s turn now, they say luck favors the Foxes, guess you’ll see.">>It’s Holly’s turn now, they say luck favors the Foxes, guess you’ll see.

She lines up at the gun, no doubt thinking the same things you did.

"You could have told me this thing was impossible to aim. You’d think this thing was a weapon of mass destruction with how bolted down it is."

<<continuelink "She makes good progress at the start,">>She makes good progress at the start, chipping away a similar amount to you. She seems to have slightly better control over the rate of fire than you did.

Although Holly seems to be falling into the same issues you did, as she knocks more and more of target off it gets more difficult to actually hit it. Guess this is one of the main obstacles in this game. As the game goes on it plays out very similar to your try. She ends up with about 20% of the target left but struggles to hit the rest due to flimsy target.
<<set $holly_win_int to random(40, 100)>>
<<if $holly_win_int gte 60>>
Holly also ends up at the same point you did towards the end. She’s only got about 3 more trigger pulls before she runs out of ammo.

She lines up a shot to knock out the rest of the target, she pulls the trigger, but the pellets just fly past the paper as it gives way. 
Holly sighs, no doubt frustrated by this tedious game.

Holly lines up another shot in attempt to win this damn game. She pulls the trigger and the pellets land right on target, getting rid of the remaining bits of the target.

To your surprise, Holly actually managed to pull it off and win!

The game vendor begrudgingly offers Holly a choice of any cheaply made stuffed animal they have on display. Among those displayed are a Dragon, a German Shepard, and a $race.

Holly picks the $race. A funny coincidence all things considered, but that’s probably all it is, a coincidence.
<<else>>
Holly’s nearing the end of the game, unfortunately, it seems she isn’t going to make it. There’s a good chunk of the target left, with her gun only having 40 rounds left.

She gets a few more bursts off before the gun clicks and runs out of ammo. She made a good effort but it just wasn’t enough.

:: Valery Walk {"position":"1202,399","size":"100,100"}
After a day of working on your road trip itinerary you decide to get some fresh air and go on a walk around the neighborhood. It’s a beautiful day outside, the temperature is a refreshing 78 and there’s a slight breeze off the lake making this almost a perfect day.

You start your walk off by going your usual route, the road you take loops around, so it doesn’t really matter which way you take. The walk starts off pretty well, with nothing of note really happening, just the usually affair with you waving to the people you usually see walking a bout.

<<continuelink "As you walk around the neighborhood you recall one of the houses near you being put up for rent recently.">>As you walk around the neighborhood you recall one of the houses near you being put up for rent recently. As you walk past it you see that the ‘for rent sign’ has been removed, seems somebody’s renting it now. You were somewhat familiar with the last person that lived there, you wouldn’t have considered yourselves friends, but you talked on occasion. He left on pretty good terms it would seem, you talked to him right before he left and he stated he was moving west since he got a big job offer from one of the big tech companies out there. You’ll have to say hi to whoever moved in there if you see them around them neighborhood. You’re pretty familiar with everybody else in the nearby area so it shouldn’t be too difficult to spot them.

<<continuelink "You’re just about done with your walk at this point.">>You’re just about done with your walk at this point. You climb up the hill that eclipses your house, as you reach the top you can see your house right in view. While walking down the hill and towards your house you see someone unfamiliar coming towards you. You assume it to be the new person renting the house near your house. Sensing an opportunity to meet who you assume to be your new neighbor; you think about waving him down and introducing yourself. 

Although, there’s no guarantee that’s who he really is, and if he ended up just being some random guy, it could end up being a bit awkward.

He’s approaching you and you have to make decision; you decide that it would be best to:
<<choice [[Wave him down and say hi.|Valery Walk Dialogue]]>>
<<choice [[Just ignore him and go on your way.|Valery Walk No Dialogue]]>>


:: Valery Walk Dialogue {"position":"1139,269","size":"100,100"}
You say fuck it, and decide to go over and say hi to who you presume to be your new neighbor. You figure that you aren’t really out anything if it ends up just being some guy off the street. You wave him down as you walk towards him. 

This seems a bit odd in your mind, but if the roles were reversed you probably wouldn’t think too much of it.

You walk up to the slimly built Hyena and ask him if he’s the guy that moved into the newly rented house near you.

<<continuelink '"I am, actually."'>>"I am, actually. Just moved in a week ago.” The hyena says in a some what confused tone. Probably surprised that you were able to figure that out.

You introduce yourself as $name to the hyena, he replies and says “I’m Valery, nice to meet you $name.”

<<continuelink '"I have to say, you have quite the initiative."'>> "I have to say, you have quite the initiative. I think you’re the first neighbor I’ve talked to so far. I’ve seen a few people out but none of them were gutsy enough to walk up and introduce themselves."

"Really though, I appreciate it. It’s nice to get to know my neighbors, helps me feel a bit more at ease."

<<continuelink "You tell Valery that you’re glad you could make him feel a bit more at ease.">>You tell Valery that you’re glad you could make him feel a bit more at ease.

:: Bank Management {"position":"113,575","size":"100,100"}
Going on this road trip is going to be a pretty big expense, the mere $1500 you have in your bank account likely won’t be enough to supply you and your pals throughout the entire road trip. Odds are you’ll have to look into getting some money from your savings and possibly cash-out some of your investments.

You figure it’s probably best to take money from your savings first, so you browse to your bank’s website and login to your account. You currently have $1500 in your checking account and $8500 in your savings. $10,000 is a pretty decent amount but you’re still not sure if that’s going to be enough, so you decide to spent some time figuring out a rough estimate of what you expect the trip to cost just based off the cost of lodging, food, and transportation.

<<continuelink "You’re rough estimates some out to around $8500 total.">>You’re rough estimates some out to around $8500 total. That’s a fairly frugal estimate, and only includes the basics. You’d be able to cover those expensive without too much of an issue, but if it ended up being more expensive than that it could get a bit dicey. That’s not to mention the issue that comes from completely draining your bank account. Doing so would likely mean having to either get a normal job again or working on more contracts than usual.

You could take out some funds from your investment accounts, although that obviously offers its own set of problems. Mostly long-term problems rather than the short-term nature of draining your bank account. Problems like delaying your planned early retirement. Going this route would prevent any financial issues from arising during the road trip, however.

Ultimately it comes down to rather you want to potentially risk your short-term future or certainly harm your long-term future. Do you want to risk problems arising during the road trip in lieu of a better long-term outcome? Or do you want to be certain you’ll have enough funds for the whole trip?

It’s your choice…

"Hey, $name. I was wondering if you were really going to come down or not. Unfortunately, you’ve come down at a pretty bad time, as I’ve got work in about half an hour.”

Seems like Valery hasn’t gotten here yet; you’ll have to wait around a bit and see if he shows up. If not you’ll just head in and get a table.

<<continuelink "It takes a couple more minutes...">>It takes a couple more minutes for Valery to finally arrive, as he pulls into the parking lot you exit your car and head towards the entrance of the restaurant, The Rat's Place.

The Rat’s Place is situated just off the lake, the building itself is painted in a light blue color, with white accents. The side facing the lake is made almost entirely of glass, offering a spectacular view if you manage to get a seat on that side of the restaurant. 

As you wait at the entrance of the restaurant for Valery, you read one of the plaques near the seating area. The plaque states that the restaurant is named after a set of critically acclaimed movies, called “The Rat Movies”. It says they were directed by some guy who goes by the name ‘Jerma’. You aren’t sure who that is, but if he has a restaurant named after his work, he must be a pretty popular guy. You have to imagine he’s pretty tall and handsome, with a great sense of humor as well.

“Hey, $name. How’s it going? This place just lets you pick your own seat, so we can just head over here and sit at one of these tables.”

You follow Valery to the table, it would seem that the table he picked is on the lakeside of the restaurant, the mostly glass wall lets you as far out as the horizon!

Hi! You've reached the current end of Tales from the Road. Once/if I finish part 3, this is where you'll go on to play either Holly's date that you setup or you'd start finalizing the plans for the road trip.

I recommend hitting the back button in the top left corner and saving on the last page you were on. Once/if I release the next update you //should// be able to load that save and continue without any problems.

Also, thanks for playing! If you have any feedback for me, feel free to leave it on the Itch.io page.

Walking through the entrance you can see the map of the park and a few fountains. Looking at the map, it would seem that this is more of an urban park as it lacks the expansive walking trails found in some of the more rural parks, like that one near you. While this park might not be as nice for just going on a walk, it seems perfect if you just want to sit down and relax or talk with someone.

<<continuelink '"Never been to this park before."'>>"Never been to this park before. I usually go to the one on Gorge street when I wanna go for a quick walk."

"So, you wanna just sit down and chill for a bit? Because honestly, that sounds like a better time than walking through this place."

You decide to follow Valery’s suggestion and just sit down at a bench and talk for a bit.

"Man, it has been a long time since I’ve been able to just sit down with someone and talk about - just whatever really." Valery says as he seems to relax a bit. 

"You’ve been asking me all these questions, so I think it's my turn to ask you some. Let's start off with a an easy one, what kind of music do you like to listen to?""

<<choice [[Metal and harder rock is usually what I listen too.|MPV 1]]>>

"Alright, not a bad choice. I'm more of an alt-rock guy myself, used to just listen to regular rock but I got kind of bored of it, mainly because mainstream rock hasn't changed that much since the 2000s."

"I was actually listening to whatever the top rock song of last year was and I seriously thought I was listening to a song from 2004, It had the same exact sound as a rock song from around 2004. The only thing that gave away the fact it was a song made in 2018 was a lyric in the song mentioning the year 2018. Shame to see such a storied and formerly great genre turn into a boring and stagnant mess."

"Alt-rock and indie rock have sort of gone the way I would have expected rock too, lot more experimentation and different sound styles." 

"But that's enough about music, let's talk more about you. Here's another questions for ya, how long have you lived in Iridium City?"


<<continuelink "You tell Valery that you’ve been living here for around 3 years.">>You tell Valery that you’ve been living here for around 3 years. Before that you were in college and then during your childhood your family lived in Sprucetown, which is about 2 hours east from where you live now.

"Sprucetown is still by the lake right, right? So you’ve been living in a city by the lake for most of your life. I’ve lived in-state my whole life as well but never by the lake, until recent of course."

<<continuelink "You ask Valery where he lived before moving here.">>You ask Valery where he lived before moving here.

“Just before moving here? Nagysburg. Lived there for 3 years until recent. Before that I lived in Fulton, which is where I grew up and went to college. Ended up staying there a year after graduating since I got a job at a local company.”

<<choice [[How’d your time in Nagysburg and Fulton compare to your time here so far?|MPV 2.1]]>>

"My time in Nagysburg was pretty similar to here. Main difference is that in Nagysburg I had something resembling a friend group, while here I know you and that’s pretty much it. The job I had in Nagysburg wasn’t that great though. Hardly any paid time off and the insurance was trash. I’ve had it a lot better here in that regard. Fulton’s a bit more complex. I had a great social life there, after all that’s where pretty every friend I made up until graduation lived."

<<continuelink '"But I couldn’t help but feel unfulfilled."'>>"But I couldn’t help but feel unfulfilled. I’d lived my whole life there and it was really starting to drag on. You see the same people, drive the same roads to the same place your parents worked at when you were growing up. It got mundane, and honestly a little depressing. Life wasn’t really exciting anymore, I felt like I was just running off a script doing the same thing week after week."

"So I started looking for jobs a fair ways away from home. Applied to a bunch of them but of course only a few asked me to interview. The company in Nagysburg ended up offering me the best salary and was in a pretty nice city so I figured that was probably my best bet. Ended up being a pretty nice experience. Got along really well with my coworkers and my neighbors as well, they ended up being part of that friend group I was talking about."

You get up shortly after and [[head back to your car.|Valery Park Transistion 2]]

You lean in towards Valery, moving your head towards his and wrapping your arms around his shoulders. 

Valery also wraps his arms around you, pulling you closer to him.

You embrace with Valery and share a passionate kiss. Chills run down your back, and butterflys fill your stomach as you take in the moment.

The kiss ends after what seems like 5 minutes, though you know it was much shorter. While still holding you quite close, Valery speaks up.

<<if $gender is "Male">>
"Would you believe that was my first time kissing a guy? I've considered myself bisexual for a while but never really got romantically involved with a guy. Just couldn't find one that was my type; guess that changed tonight"

"We'll just leave it at that for now, I don't go all in on the first date. See you around the neighborhood, $name. We'll have to talk about setting up a second date sometime." Valery says as he winks and walks back to his car.

That went about as well as it could have all things considered. Hard to believe that you came into this barely knowing Valery. You also have to say, you feel pretty special about being the first guy Val's kissed, especially considering how picky he seems to be.

"You're quite the kisser, have to say it took me by surprise. Have to imagine you'll only get better, you'll have plenty of time to practice with me. That'll be it for now though, I don't go all in on the first date."

"Well, see you around the neighborhood, $name. We'll have to sit down and talk about setting up our second date sometime." Valery says as he winks and walks back to his car.

"Yeah I that's just how life can be sometimes. Keeps you on your toes, I guess."

"Well it's 5 PM now and we've been talking since we got at the restaurant at 1. It's been a great day but I suppose it's about time for us to head home. Can't remember the last I was actually disappointed about having to go home. Now, come here and give me a hug before we leave."

"You really don't. And if you really think about, it's crazy how circumstantial stuff can be. Like, if I had moved somewhere else in town, I probably never would have met you. And that's just one example. When you really think about it, your life could be dramatically different just based off a few seemingly minor decisions. Like where you decide to work, where you go to college, where you live, etc. Those all affect the kind of people you met, the kind of people your around. I don’t know, it’s just kind of crazy to me."

"Anway, it's 5 PM now and we've been talking since we got at the restaurant at 1. It's been a great day but I suppose it's about time for us to head home. Can't remember the last I was actually disappointed about having to go home. Now, come here and give me a hug before we leave."

/* Transistion over the Holly date or next part depending on the choices. Next area not currently implemented */

Hi! You've reached the current end of Tales from the Road. Once/if I finish part 3, this is where you'll go on to play either Holly's date that you setup or you'd start finalizing the plans for the road trip.

I recommend hitting the back button in the top left corner and saving on the last page you were on. Once/if I release the next update you //should// be able to load that save and continue without any problems.

Also, thanks for playing! If you have any feedback for me, feel free to leave it on the Itch.io page.

"I'm glad you took that as well as you did. I know there's some real pieces of work out there that go insane as soon as you tell them you have no interest in them. I'm happy you're not one of them."

"I wouldn't say this is a complete denial but... yeah, honestly I just don't see "us" working out. So I guess it kind of is."

"Anway, I suppose we should head home, we've wasted enough time talking here." Valery stands up and extends his hand towards you "I hope we can at least part as friends."

"I'm glad you understand. I thought that maybe I'd see something different in you here, but I didn't. It's not your fault, we just aren't a good match."

"Don't get me wrong, I don't hate you or anything. I just... don't really see a serious relationship between the two of us going anywhere."

Valery reaches out his hand to you "I hope we can stay friends, though."

<<choice [[*Get up and shake his hand* Friends it is.|MPV Four Ending 2.1]]>>

"Valery grabs and shakes your hand 'I'm glad you feel the same, $name. Hopefully I'll still see you round the neighborhood!"

You say your goodbyes to Valery and tell him you're happy to have another friend to count on.

"Damn straight. You can never have enough real friends. See you later."
